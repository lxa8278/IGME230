## Proposal (proposal.html)
### Avoid Losing to the Acidic Blue
#### I. Concept
Avoid Losing to the Acidic Blue is a simple puzzle game of getting from point A to point B. Your mouse will be placed in a specific position on the game screen in an uncolored area. Point B is marked on the screen in another uncolored area. The player must maneuver and avoid the blue spots in the game window.

#### II. Platform
This game will be available on desktop.

#### III. Theme and Aesthetics
The main idea of the game is to test the player's intuitive thinking in solving a puzzle in a browser game. It's simple, geometric visuals will not overwhelm the player. The simplicity of the game will be emphasized by the 8-bit music.

#### IV. Gameplay
##### Mechanics
The player must progress through levels (Achievement) and will use Cascading Information Theory to slowly increase the difficulty of each levels. Disincentives will be utilized when a player fails in not touching the blue by sending them back to the previous level.
##### Controls
The player will use the mouse and keyboard.
##### Teaching the game/player learning
The only direction the player is given is to avoid any of the blue spots. The player will be introduced to more difficult situations and the player would be even a hint to use the keyboard and to observe the name of the game (ALTTAB).
